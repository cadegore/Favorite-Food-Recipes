    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Arrange 1/2 of the green onions on the bottom of the steaming bowl (it is important to steam
        in a container in order to retain the steam and juices around the fish).
      </li>
      <li>Place 1/2 of the mushrooms and Napa cabbage sections on top of the onions.</li>
      <li>
        Place fish on top of the vegetables. Sprinkle ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes over
        fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with the remaining green onions, mushrooms, and napa cabbage. Drizzle soy sauce and
        water over everything.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place steam bowl in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Steam for 15 to 20
        minutes, or until fish flakes easily. Garnish with cilantro, if desired.
